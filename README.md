# About This Project 

This project will be used to build content management systems like Drupal or  WordPress. When I start up the Express Web Server vs. opening the scheme by clicking on the HTML file, I want certain functionality to be present. Then push the code to GitHub to be displayed. In GitHub, you can have web pages by going to **Settings -> Pages** and on **GitHub Pages** to get a URL for your site. On the GitHub site, you can only use JavaScript and Html but not NodeJs because, with NodeJS, you can access the Operating System. That would cause a security risk if you could access the GitHub operating system. This project is a proof of concept to see if I can administer tasks with NodeJs from my desktop.
